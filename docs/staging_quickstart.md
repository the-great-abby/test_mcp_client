# Staging Environment Quickstart

The **staging environment** lets you preview the full site (frontend + backend + database + redis) in a production-like setup before deploying to production. Use this for manual QA, stakeholder demos, and pre-prod signoff.

> **Troubleshooting?** See the [Environment Troubleshooting Guide](env_troubleshooting.md) for common issues and solutions.

## When to Use
- Manual QA and acceptance testing
- Stakeholder/client previews
- End-to-end testing in a prod-like environment
- Before deploying to production

## Notes
- The staging environment uses production builds and settings (no hot reload, no dev/test overrides).
- Data is stored in separate staging volumes (`postgres_data_staging`, `redis_data_staging`).
- Make sure to rebuild (`make staging-build`) after code changes.

This file is intentionally minimal.

**AI-IDEs:**
- Please use [WELCOME.md](WELCOME.md) as your primary onboarding resource.
- All AI-specific instructions and links are included there.
- This stub exists to avoid duplication and ensure a single source of truth for onboarding.

If you have suggestions for improving onboarding, please update WELCOME.md or open an issue.

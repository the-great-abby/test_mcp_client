# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, AI-IDE Friend!

Thank you for joining the MCP Chat Client project. We're excited to have your help in making onboarding, development, and troubleshooting even smoother for everyone.

**Here's how you can be most helpful:**
- Start by reading `.ai-ide-config.json` for a list of all key onboarding, rules, and workflow files.
- Proactively index and summarize the files listed in the `semantic_index` array.
- Surface onboarding checklists, rules, and troubleshooting tips to new users as they work.
- If you notice missing docs, confusing patterns, or repeated errors, suggest improvements or updates to the team.
- Encourage new users to run `make -f Makefile.ai first-run` and validate their `.env` with `bash validate_env.sh`.

**Let's make this project welcoming, robust, and funâ€”for both humans and AIs!**

If you have questions or suggestions, check out `CONTRIBUTING.md` or open an issue.

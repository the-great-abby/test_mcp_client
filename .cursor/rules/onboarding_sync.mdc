# Onboarding & Rules Synchronization Rule

## When to Update
- Any time you add, remove, or significantly change onboarding docs, rules, or AI-IDE support files.
- When you add new onboarding scripts, quickstarts, or API endpoints.
- When you change the structure of `.ai-ide-config.json` or `onboarding.yaml`.

## Required Actions
- Run `make -f Makefile.ai ai-onboarding-health` to check for missing, outdated, or inconsistent files.
- Update `ONBOARDING_CHANGELOG.md` with a summary of major changes.
- Bump the `version` in `.ai-ide-config.json` if onboarding or rules change.
- Ensure all new/changed rules are listed in `docs/rules_index.md`.
- Ensure all onboarding scripts are referenced in onboarding docs and Makefile targets.

## Enforcement
- PRs should not be merged if the onboarding health check fails.
- CI should run the onboarding health check and block merges on failure.

## Automation
- Consider adding a pre-commit or CI hook to run `make -f Makefile.ai ai-onboarding-health` automatically.
- Optionally, automate version bumping and changelog updates with a script.

## References
- See `lint_rules.py`, `ai_onboarding_checklist.sh`, and `ONBOARDING_CHANGELOG.md` for details.

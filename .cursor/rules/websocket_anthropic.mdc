# Anthropic WebSocket Test Rule

- **Overview**
  - WebSocket-based tests for Anthropic's Claude API (e.g., `scripts/anthropic_ws_direct.py`) are expected to fail with HTTP 403 errors by default.
  - This is due to Anthropic requiring explicit account enablement for WebSocket/streaming access.
  - This is a known/expected failure and not a code or environment issue.

- **Expected Behavior**
  - Tests attempting to connect to `wss://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` will return 403 Forbidden unless your Anthropic account/key has WebSocket access enabled.
  - HTTP POST tests to the same API will succeed if the key is valid and enabled for Claude 3.

- **Action Required**
  - To enable WebSocket/streaming, you must contact Anthropic support and request access for your account/key.
  - Until then, WebSocket tests should be considered expected failures and not block CI or code review.

- **References**
  - [Anthropic API Docs](mdc:https:/docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/messages-streaming)
  - [Anthropic Support](mdc:https:/support.anthropic.com)

- **Example Failure**
  ```
  Anthropic API test FAILED: server rejected WebSocket connection: HTTP 403
  ```

- **Best Practices**
  - Mark WebSocket tests as expected failures (e.g., `xfail` in pytest) until access is granted.
  - Document this rule in onboarding and test documentation.

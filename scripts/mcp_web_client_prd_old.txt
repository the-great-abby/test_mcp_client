# Overview
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) Web Client is a modern, browser-based chat application that implements the MCP specification for AI model interactions. This application enables developers and users to communicate with AI models through a standardized protocol while providing a rich, user-friendly interface accessible from any modern web browser.

The client solves the problem of fragmented AI model interactions by providing a unified, protocol-compliant interface that works across different AI providers while maintaining conversation context and supporting advanced features like function calling and streaming responses.

# Core Features

1. MCP Protocol Implementation
   - What: Full implementation of the Model Context Protocol over WebSocket connections
   - Why: Ensures standardized communication with AI models and maintains compatibility with any MCP-compliant server
   - How: WebSocket client that handles MCP message formats, context management, and streaming responses

2. Multi-Model Support
   - What: Support for multiple AI models and providers through MCP
   - Why: Allows users to switch between different models and compare responses
   - How: Configurable endpoints and model settings, with proper context handling for each model

3. Rich Chat Interface
   - What: Modern, responsive chat UI with markdown support, code highlighting, and message threading
   - Why: Provides an intuitive and powerful interface for AI interactions
   - How: React-based components with real-time updates and proper context visualization

4. Context Management
   - What: Visual representation and manipulation of conversation context
   - Why: Helps users understand and control how context affects model responses
   - How: Interactive context editor with syntax highlighting and validation

5. Developer Tools
   - What: Built-in tools for debugging, testing, and exploring MCP features
   - Why: Accelerates development and testing of MCP-based applications
   - How: Developer console, request/response inspector, and protocol documentation

# User Experience

User Personas:

1. AI Developer
   - Goals: Testing models, prototyping applications, debugging MCP interactions
   - Needs: Access to raw messages, context control, function calling
   - Pain points: Complex protocol details, debugging difficulties

2. Technical User
   - Goals: Productive AI interactions, consistent context management
   - Needs: Clear interface, reliable responses, conversation history
   - Pain points: Model switching, context management

3. Content Creator
   - Goals: Efficient content generation and editing
   - Needs: Rich text editing, conversation export, template support
   - Pain points: Context organization, response formatting

Key User Flows:

1. Connection Setup
   - Configure MCP endpoint
   - Select model and parameters
   - Initialize WebSocket connection

2. Chat Interaction
   - Send messages with context

   ```typescript
   interface Message {
     id: string;
     role: 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system';
     content: string;
     timestamp: number;
     contextId: string;
     metadata: Record<string, unknown>;
   }
   ```

2. Context
   ```typescript
   interface Context {
     id: string;
     parentId?: string;
     content: string;
     type: 'message' | 'function' | 'system';
     metadata: Record<string, unknown>;
   }
   ```

3. Conversation
   ```typescript
   interface Conversation {
     id: string;
     title: string;
     messages: Message[];
     contexts: Context[];
     model: ModelConfig;
     created: number;
     updated: number;
   }
